[B]SimpleBan[/B] - Simple, but hardcore ban directed for offline-mode server needs.
[B]Version:[/B] v1.0

[b]You need GroupManager(+FakePermissions) / Permissions to use this.[/b]

Who has an Offline-mode server knows how hard it is to keep banned players away.
In my opinion, it's easier to ban the most possible. 
You need to keep both usernames and IPs banned.
And that's not enough, if a player changes names, or IP, you want to ban those too.

Now you can do that automatically with one single command.

[B]Features:[/B]
¥ Ban Name + IP with one single command.
¥ Ban new IP automatically if a player connects with a name matching an already banned player.
¥ Ban [b]new/b] player name automatically if matches an already banned IP. (if that name is connected for the first time on the server)
¥ Ban Name + IP even if player is offline, because it creates an history of last-IP per username.
